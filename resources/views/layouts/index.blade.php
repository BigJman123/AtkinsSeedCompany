          Having been with Pioneer for over 40 years, Dale Atkins knows the seed business!  In 1998, he and his wife Sheryle built a large facility on U.S. Route 24 to house their growing business.  Their son Dean also joined the business to help in its expansion.

          Besides offering the traditional seed corn, soybeans and wheat to area farmers, the Atkins' offer agronomy services, and seed treatment.  Joining Precision Planting in 1997 has provided a way for them to help local farmers take advantage of cutting-edge technology when planting.

          Finally, being integrally involved in the area planting, it is natural for us to offer these same farmers another alternative for their crop insurance needs.  The company is now affiliated with Rural Community Insurance Services which offers a full line of services for area farmers.
